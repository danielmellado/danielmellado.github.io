What's Zuul?

# Zuul

## Primer

* Zuul started out as part of OpenStack project.
--

* Repo: https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul/
--

* Zuul is a program that drives continuous integration, delivery, and
  deployment systems with a focus on project gating and interrelated projects.
--

## Goals

* Provide project gating and CI, specially in scenarios involving multiple
  repositories with integrated deliverables.

---

# Zuul Components

## Zuul Components

---

# Zuul Components

## Zuul Architecture

* Zuul
  * Zuul Executor: Are responsible for running jobs. They prepare an
    environment in which to run Ansible which contains all of the git
    repositories specified by the job.
  * Zuul Merger: Help with git operations around the course of the Zuul Work.
--

* Nodepool
  * is a system for managing test node resources. It supports
  launching single-use test nodes from cloud providers as well as managing
  access to pre-defined pre-existing nodes. Nodepool is part of a suite of
  tools that form a comprehensive test system, including Zuul.
  * Nodepool-builder: builds and uploads images to clouds.
  * Nodepool-launcher: responsible for managing cloud instances launched from
    the images built from nodepool-builder.

# Repositories

## Config split in several repos

Current config repositories:

* https://github.com/ansible/project-config
* https://github.com/ansible-network/windmill-config
* https://github.com/ansible/ansible-zuul-jobs

--

Why:

* Zuul starts by loading the configuration in the project-config zuul.d
  directory in the project-config repository
* Then it loads configuration from the windmill-config repo.
  * Windmill is just a set of roles and installer for Zuul (Note: It
    self-deploys each couple of hours)
* Then it loads jobs from the ansible-zuul-jobs zuul.d directory in the
  ansible-zuul-jobs repository which is where we keep most of the
  OpenStack-specific jobs.

## Zuul Onboarding

**Pipeline:** In Zuul, a pipeline encompasses a workflow process which can be
applied to one or more projects. For instance, a “check” pipeline might
describe the actions which should cause newly proposed changes to projects to
be tested.</br>
**Job:** A job is a unit of work performed by Zuul on an item enqueued into a pipeline.

--

**Defined in:** project.yaml

```yaml
---
- project:
    templates:
      - ansible-python-jobs
    check:
      jobs:
        - ansible-network-eos-appliance
        - ansible-network-ios-appliance
        - ansible-network-iosxr-appliance
        - ansible-network-junos-appliance
        - ansible-network-openvswitch-appliance
        - ansible-network-vyos-appliance
```

## How to add a new job


**Where?:** zuul.d on ansible-zuul-jobs.<br/>

--

```yaml
- job:
    name: ansible-network-junos-appliance
    parent: ansible-network-appliance-base
    pre-run: playbooks/ansible-network-junos-appliance/pre.yaml
    run: playbooks/ansible-network-junos-appliance/run.yaml
    host-vars:
      vsrx3-18.4R1:
        ansible_connection: network_cli
        ansible_network_os: junos
    required-projects:
      - name: github.com/ansible/ansible-zuul-jobs
    nodeset: vsrx3-18.4R1-python37
```

# Ansible-Networking Zuul

## How to make a job non-voting?

--

**Solution:** just add the non-voting flag to it!

```yaml
- job:
    name: ansible-network-junos-appliance
    parent: ansible-network-appliance-base
    pre-run: playbooks/ansible-network-junos-appliance/pre.yaml
    run: playbooks/ansible-network-junos-appliance/run.yaml
    host-vars:
      vsrx3-18.4R1:
        ansible_connection: network_cli
        ansible_network_os: junos
    required-projects:
      - name: github.com/ansible/ansible-zuul-jobs
    nodeset: vsrx3-18.4R1-python37
    voting: false
```

# Ansible-Networking Zuul

## How to add a new platform

* Zuul just works mostly with openstack cloud, so just add a qcow2!

--

* Tool to do so? : https://github.com/ansible-network/network-image-builder

--

**Network Image builder**
```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: network-image-builder
      vars:
        src_image_path: "{{ image.src_image_path }}"
        image_name: "{{ image.image_name }}"
        admin_user_password: myadminpass
        regular_user_password: myregularpass
```

---

# Conclusions

## Did we enhance something?

* We achieve pre-merge testing, which is itself a great improvement. So far
  we also have fixed a lot of broken code that was around before Zuul was
  active.

--
* It provides a way to perform integration testing in between releases, and
  ensure that any release and backport works with a set of available nodes.
  Most of the work that was needed was to get the network images working.
